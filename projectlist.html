 <h1 class="display-3"><font size="16">A list of my projects so far!</font></h1>
<h2><font size="4"> My litmus test for showing a project here is that I have to be able to say: "this is pretty cool" </h2>
<ol>
 <li><a link href="project3.pdf">Single Bus Non Pipelined Control Unit</a>  </li> 
 <p1> This project was assigned as a part of Intro to Computer Architecture & Organization (EECE3026). 
 We were given a set of 16 instructions loosely based on the IBM370 and MIPS instruction sets and tasked to
 design and implement a CPU for them at the gate level using a single bus paradigm . 
 Logisim was used to implement the state machine for the control unit at the gate level.  </p1> <br> </br>
 
 <li><a link href="project4.pdf">Pipelined Control Unit</a>  </li> 
 <p1> This project was an extension of the Non-Pipelined Control Unit project. 
 Using the same instruction set, we now had to design a datapath and control that would execute the instructions
 in a pipelined manner. The big challenge of this project was designing the datapath so as to avoid the many data 
 dependencies/hazards that executing the instructions presented.</p1> <br> </br>
 
 <li><a href="https://twitter.com/a_time_quotebot">Adventure Time Quote Bot</a>  </li> 
 <p1> This is a quotebot using Python's Twython package. It tweets a random quote from a list of hundreds
  of adventure time quotes when run. I typically have it run on a Raspberry Pi 3 using a cronjob. 
  Example bot code can be found on my github account. </p1> <br> </br>
