Hello everyone, and welcome to the first post of my blog "just another blog".  I have been toying around 
with the idea of writing a blog for about 4 years now (including some poorly constructed wix blogs) but I am just getting around to it now.
I suppose the main goals of the blog are to make sure my long form writing (read: longer than a tweet) skills don't atrophy too much, and to 
just get my ideas and opinions written out for my own edification. Now...onto the important stuff.

For those of you that don't know, League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. The objective of the game is to 
capture the enemy team's nexus (base) by destroying their defenses on the map and collecting a gold advantage over the other team. Each
team is composed of 5 players, with over 150 characters (champions) for each player to choose from. 

This game took up roughly all of my free time from 2012-2016. For all intents and purposes I have stopped playing since then. The chief reasons being school and work
becoming too busy, and the game becoming a lot less enjoyable than it used to be. That being said, I don't regret all of the time I spent playing or learning about the game. 
Although League didn't help me reach sprititual enlightenment, I did actually pick up an important life skill from all those games played: the growth mindset.

Recently I have been reading a lot about the benefits of the growth mindset on websites such as LinkedIn and CNBC. Additionally, it is one
of Microsoft's guiding principles for their corporate culture. The growth mindset essentially states that you can develop any talent or skill you want
through dedication and perseverance. This is opposed to the fixed mindset, where you are inherently "good" or "bad" at something.

Since League of Legends is a team game, it is very easy to adopt the fixed mindset. "Oh, I just lost because my teammates were bad."
"There was nothing I could have possibly done to win this game." I thought this way at first as well, and during this period my skill in the game
stagnated. I soon realized that the only thing I could control in matches was my own demeanor and performance. Once I started to critically
evaluate my performance in games to see what I could have done better, I started to notice drastic improvement.

Another component of the growth mindset is to not be afraid of failure. When you initially pick up a new skill or hobby, you will most likely
be horrible at it. The same goes for playing new characters in League. I was the sole reason for my team's defeat in Numerous games while learning
the ins and outs of different characters. However, I knew that I wasn't losing the games because I was "bad" at that character. I simply had not had enough
practice yet. I stuck with it and soon enough, some of those new characters became my strongest.

Although I didn't have a word for it at the time, what I had learned from those [redacted number] of League games is the growth mindset.
Once I realized the benefits the growth mindset yielded for me in League of Legends, I immediately began applying it to other parts of my life.
In fact, I attribute much the success I have encountered in school and work since 2016 to the growth mindset.

All those hours wasted in front of the computer actually did amount to something.  ~
