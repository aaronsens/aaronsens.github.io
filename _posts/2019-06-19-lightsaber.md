This blog post details my thoughts about lightsaber duels in Star Wars, and why a Star Wars movie will never have fight scenes like Episode 3 ever again. 

Episode 3 – definitely the most action packed episode in all three trilogies (so far). From start to finish, Episode 3 has at least 5 lightsaber duels, and many more lightsaber action sequences besides that. The plot lines of Anakin’s downfall and the resolution of the Clone Wars provided ample opportunities for action scenes. That combined with the cutting edge CGI technology compared to earlier movies, led Episode 3 to be the most lightsaber heavy movie of the saga. 

 In the original trilogy, lightsaber duels are slower paced (the blades are “heavier”) and have much more emotional buildup. Typically there is only one duel, and it happens during the climax of the film. The slower duels of the original trilogy can also be attributed to the SFX technology of the time. In A New Hope, the blades could not even touch during shooting because they would shatter. Obviously limitations like these would hamper the flashiness of any action scene. 

Fast forward the SFX technology 17 years and we get the Phantom Menace. Lightsabers have essentially become as light as glow sticks. Additionally, lightsaber duels are rarely used for the emotional development of characters, but more for a generic “good vs evil” conflict. In the prequel trilogy lightsabers are whipped out at very opportunity. This gives them less of the mythical aura they had in the original trilogy. While these prequel duels don’t really evoke the same emotional weight as original trilogy ones, the over the top effects and cinematography are fun to watch.

Outside of the action sequences the prequel trilogy has a very mixed legacy. I think the overall fan reception of the prequels and a desire to recapture the spirit of the original trilogy led Disney to go with the “heavier lightsaber” interpretation for the sequel trilogy. The Force Awakens is a prime example of this (there were no lightsaber duels in The Last Jedi). Not only is there tension built up between Kylo and Rey throughout the movie, but the choreography of the fight is very similar to original trilogy duels. 

I think both interpretations of lightsaber duels are valid. They are enjoyable to watch as devices to further the plot AND as eye candy. However Disney’s choice to return to form was a death sentence for the prequel style duel. I’m sad we will never get to see a lightsaber fight like Episodes I-III in a new Star Wars movie with 2019 technology and a Disney budget.  That being said, there is plenty of potential for future TV/streaming series to have these type of fights, as the Clone Wars TV show has shown.
